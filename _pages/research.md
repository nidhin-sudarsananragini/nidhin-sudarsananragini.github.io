## Research themes

### Distinguishability of quantum devices

The inability to perfectly distinguish or discriminate between every possible pair of quantum states is a genuine feature of quantum theory. This feature ramify itself in quantum information processing when states of quantum systems are perceived as informational units.

### Higher-order quantum theory
