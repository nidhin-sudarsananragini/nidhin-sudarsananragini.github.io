## Research themes


### Higher-order quantum theory

Higher-order quantum theory(HOQT) comprises of all process theories admissible by quantum theory. In each such process theory, we study transformations 
and measurements of the process of interest. 

### Distinguishability of quantum devices

The inability to perfectly distinguish or discriminate between every possible pair of quantum states is a genuine feature of quantum theory. This feature ramify itself in quantum information processing when states of quantum systems are perceived as informational units.

### Incompatible devices in quantum theory
Inability to implement or perform certain joint measurements is a genuine feature of quantum theory. 

### Indefinite causal orders in quantum theory

Skeptical about this
